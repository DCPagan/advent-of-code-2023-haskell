# aoc-template

This is an (opinionated) Advent of Code template for solutions in Haskell.

To use:
- Clone this repository
- Set up a new branch for the year's solutions
- Change the package name, update the GitHub link, etc
- Fill in the solutions (input lives in a folder at project root called `input`, e.g. `input/Day01.txt`).

If you think a file needs changing to better suit your needs (before starting the project), then make the appropriate changes and run the `apply_changes.zsh` file.
